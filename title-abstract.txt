Title:
Demystifying Machine Learning for Facial Analysis

Abstract:
Due to the burgeoning of machine learning and artificial intelligence technology, it may feel as though there are eyes perpetually watching us. It is undeniable that, whether it is through surveillance cameras, phones, or desktops, we are always exposed to being analyzed by merely living our everyday lives. The most frightening part about this phenomenon is that most people are unaware of what is actually being seen and how. As our society begins to yield more responsibility and credibility to image analysis and other machine learning software, it is important to educate the public so that we collectively make informed decisions about them. Our interactive web application conducts facial analysis and utilizes explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to aid in communicating the inner-workings of the machine learning "black box." In addition, we discuss the importance of model fairness, role of XAI in ensuring fairness, and potential discriminatory practices that stem from the imprudent use of machine learning.
